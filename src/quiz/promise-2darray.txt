Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

1. Sum called and returning from sum printed, indicating sum2dArray called with valid input first
2. Sum called and rejecting printed, indicating sum2dArray called with invalid input second
3. returning from sum printed, stemming from second call to sum2dArray with invalid input
4. BAD INPUT printed, indicating the reject message returned by second call to sum2dArray. Invalid input logic completed asynchronously before valid input
5. resolving printed, indicating the first (valid) call to sum2dArray finished
6. 45 printed, indicating the first (valid) call to sum2dArray performed as expected
